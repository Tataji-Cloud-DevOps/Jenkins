### example of the environment variable

``````````
pipeline {

    environment { 
        ENV URL = "Pipeline.google.com"        # Global Variable : All the stages of the pipeline can inherit this
    }
    stages {
        stage('First stage') { 
            steps {
               sh "echo Welcome world!"

             environment { 
                 ENV URL = "Pipeline.google.com"  # Local Variable :Scope of the local variable is confined to this stage only
